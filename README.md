Dictionary:

The Dictionary tests certain functions within the Dictionary class. First, it creates a new dictionary called 
test. The program then adds three items to list, then creates another new list called test2. Test2 was created
using list in it's constructor, so the values should be the same in both. A variable is set to one of the values in 
test2, and then test is cleared. Then if the constructor worked and there is the value in test2 that came from
test, the program will print out that the item was there.
